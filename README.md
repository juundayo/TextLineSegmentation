# Text Line Segmentation Tool

A robust tool for segmenting handwritten documents into individual lines of text, inspired by the 2007 paper proposed by Manivannan Arivazhagan, Harish Srinivasan, and Sargur Srihari.

The segmentation process is based on **piece-wise projection profiles**, enabling dynamic line tracing even in complex layouts. 

## Key Features
- Gaussian-based line modeling
- Probabilistic decision-making for ambiguous components
- Handles overlapping and skewed lines
